## Correlated topic model

This is a C implementation of the correlated topic model (CTM), a topic model for text or other discrete data that models correlation between the occurrence of different topics in a document. The CTM is fully described in [Blei and Lafferty (2007)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/BleiLafferty2007.pdf). (For an implementation of a related topic model, latent Dirichlet allocation, click [here](https://github.com/Blei-Lab/lda-c).)

An example of the correlated topic model applied to a corpus of the journal Science can be found [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lemur/science/).

Note that this code requires the [Gnu Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).
